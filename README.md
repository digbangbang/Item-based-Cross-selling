# Item-based-Cross-selling
*This is the Item-based Cross-selling strategy from my internship in 3M.*

## Using GSC_cross_selling.py to run the entire project.

Based on the company's order data, complete the item-based collaborative filtering project, implement the recommendation algorithm.

Use the co-occurrence matrix between customers and items, establish an item inversion list based on cosine similarity, and combine user purchase experience to achieve similarity prediction.
